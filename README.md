# Furbnb :dog:
## Airbnb for dogs, but with dog bragging powers 
### *Fullstack web app (server-side rendering)*
**Technologies used:** Javascript, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, MongooseJS, HandlebarsJS, HTML, CSS.

I love dogs :heart:. I thought it would be fun to put into practice server-side rendering skills with an app that would help dog lovers like myself find or host cool daycare locations. You can also showcase your dog to the world.
